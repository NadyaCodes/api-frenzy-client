# API - MANIA

This project was made to practice creating and fetching data from APIs. 

It was created with Create-React-App and uses Axios to fetch data from a project API, and well as other public APIs. The project API consists of both local json and external API calls, and runs on an Express server.


Styling is minimal, and with CSS.

## Setup

Fork/clone project and `npm install` in both client and api directories.
